          <h2>Science:</h2>
          <p>
            The new moon is not visible because the sun and moon are on the same
            side of the Earth. At this stage, we are faced by â€˜the dark side of
            the moon'.
          </p>
          <h2>Symbolism:</h2>
          <p>
            The new moon is considered a time for fresh starts and rejuvenation,
            with women, especially, needing to regain their strength after the
            monthly cycle. This is the time for setting new intentions and
            putting the past behind you.
