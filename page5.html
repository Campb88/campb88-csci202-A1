            Waning Gibbous Moon
        </h2>
        <p>Moved to Bellingham, Washington</p><br>
        <p>This is a tremendous time of transmutation.<br>
            All of the prior elements are coming together<br>
            for a final burst of creative output.<br>
            You have seen a clear view of your own needs<br>
            and the posture of significant others.<br>
            Now the accumulation of that input<br>
            is leading to a deep, core change within you.<br>
            In this phase, you will naturally be inclined<br>
            to seek higher guidance so that you can emerge<br>
            from this transformation successfully.<br>
            This Moon favors sharing what you have learned<br>
            (and are learning) with others.
