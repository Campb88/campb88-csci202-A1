        <p>This is a time to rest, reevaluate and reflect,<br>
            pulling back into yourself to reconnect <br>
            with inner sources of strength.<br>
            Now is not a time to initiate anything new.<br>
            Its a phase suited to spending time with friends<br>
            and getting in touch with the "big picture." <br>
            A window of opportunity exists for seeing your life<br>
            objectively and becoming aware of what is important to you.<br>
            At this point, what are your dreams and aspirations?<br>
            What larger goals can you aspire to<br>
            that will bring vitality and excitement into your life?<br>
            This is a time for resting and gaining inner strength to prepare for a new cycle.
